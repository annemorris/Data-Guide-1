## American Community Survey (ACS) {#acs}
The ACS provides updated demographic statistics used for population estimates and demographic information for potential social vulnerability indicators. The data is available online at https://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/data-tables-and-tools/data-profiles.  


Minnesota ACS results can be loaded into R using the `tidycensus` package. 
Use the following code to download recent population and income estimates.
```r
