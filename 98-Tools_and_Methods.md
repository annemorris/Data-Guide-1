## Microsoft Access {#access}


> ### Hands on DEMO ðŸ”§

1. Open Access 
1. Create a new `Blank database`
    - Name it `donut_orders.accdb`
3. Select `Click to add` to add 2 new "_short text_" columns 
    - In the 1st column, right click `Field1` and choose "Rename field" and update name to `person` as the header 
          - Add 3 names of hungry people
    - In the 2nd column, rename `Field2` as `city` and add 3 cities
4. Add a 2nd table: Select `Create` from the top menu and click `Table`
    - Add a column named `person` and include at least one of the same names from the first table
          - Include a name of someone not in the first table
    - Add a 2nd column named `donut`
          - Record each person's donut order (eg. **Chocolate Glazed**)
5. Close the file and move to your R project folder

<br>

> ### Now read the data into R

```r
library(RODBC)

# Connect to Access file
## Move the Access file to your project folder
access_connect <- odbcConnectAccess2007("donut_orders.accdb")

# Load the two tables
people <- sqlFetch(access_connect, "Table1")

orders <- sqlFetch(access_connect, "Table2")

# Join the orders to the first table with `left_join()`
people_orders <- left_join(people, orders, by = "person")

```

> ### Did it work? View the joined data.

```r
View(people_orders)
```

<br>

> ### Try adding `na_matches = "never"` to left_join()


<br>

> ### Try using `full_join()`

```r
# Join orders with `full_join()`
people_orders_full <- full_join(people, orders, by = "person")

View(people_orders_full)
```

<br>

> ### What if you had rows with missing values?

1. Re-open the Access file
    - Add a person with no name to Table1 (i.e. add a city and no person name) 
    - Add two donut orders with no name to Table2
2. Re-run your R script
3. **What does the joined table look like?**
